`install.package("reshape2")`


# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This project includes an R script, `run_analysis.R`, which calculates means per activity, per subject of the mean and std deviation of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 [1]. 
The following should be downloaded and extracted directly into the working directory. 
(https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

After execution of `run_analysis.R`, the resulting dataset `tidy_data.txt` can be found in the working directory.

For futher details, refer to CodeBook.md(CodeBook.md)
